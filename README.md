# sports-league
Ruby terminal app. Practicing classes, objects, inheritance, method, arrays and tty-prompt

To run the app execute in the prompt:

```
./run_league.sh
```

There's an option to customise the name of the league (use only one word for a better user experience):
```
./run_league.sh NBA
```
This command will install all the gems needed and start the ruby app
